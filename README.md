# PhageOperonDB

The PhageOperonDB repository contains the data and files used to develop the PhageOperonDB, a mysql database of phages' operons.

## Data Collection
In this folder you will find the files retrieved from the PhiSITE database of the promoters and terminators of phages.
With this file we obtain a list os bacteriophages species that have known promoters and terminatores ('bacteriophages_list.txt').
The code created is in the JupyterNotebook 'PhiSite information.ipynb'.
